# COVID19-X-Ray-AI-Detection-Model

This is the full project folder for an artificial intelligence model built to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The model uses the DenseNet201 convolutional neural network.

The full model and results are described in this paper: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.20175828v1

This repo contains the dataset used for model training, validation, and testing, as well as the notebook where the model was built, trained, and tested.
